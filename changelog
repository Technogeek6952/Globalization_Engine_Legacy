-I forgot to update the changelog for several updates, so I'll lump all the changes
I remember into this section.

----------v1.2.1_a01---------
-Finished implementing shapes (some code still needs to be done with getTopLeftX, etc on
some shapes that don't use it much)
-Should be at exact level of functionality as v1.0, but much, MUCH cleaner, and should be
easy to expand

-Added support for plugins
	-.jdm for master file, .jdp for plugin file
		-!!!IMPORTANT!!!: Make sure if any changes were made to the master code, the .jdm 
		is recompiled - otherwise old code will be running, which can lead to confusion

	-TODO: load plugins, make inter-plugin communication system
----------v1.2_a02-----------
