# Globalization_Engine_Legacy
Old code for the Globalization engine, written in Java.

This is the java code for the engine I wrote for Globalization. I have since ported all functionality to a better-maintained c++ repository (not currently open source), and that is where I plan on continuing development. So I'm uploading this in order to reference it in the future.
