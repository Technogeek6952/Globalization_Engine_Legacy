# Globalization_Engine_Legacy
Old code for the Globalization engine, written in Java.

This is the java code for the engine I wrote for Globalization, uploaded for reference in the future. This code is a sort of first draft for some ideas I had for the engine, but it lived a little too long, building up bad conventions and quick fixes to test new ideas. I have since ported all functionality to a better-maintained c++ codebase (not currently open source), and that is where I plan on continuing development.
